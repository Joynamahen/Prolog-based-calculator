# Prolog-based-calculator

Note that prolog is an ancient language, and now for a few days, it is very doubtful that someone can 
learn it. And what I am going to do is a tiny professional framework that calculates numbers by main 
operators.

I’m considering 4 main operations. There are:

❖ Addition

❖ Subtraction

❖ Multiplication

❖ Division


How to Run it


Open SWI-Prolog and go to menu then select file calculator.pl
The following pictures illustrate how this prolog system works. There are some other output screenshots 
of my work as well.
